This is a ongoing hobby project created with C++ and OpenGL, the purpose is getting knowledge
and have fun programming things from scratch.

It is not a Bootcamp guided project or something that are produced in courses or books.

The project is being created with no previous knowledge in Graphics Programing (This is a Graphics 'Poorgraming')

The sources of knowledge for this fun project is being extracted from the book [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com), 
the [CMake](https://cmake.org/documentation/) docs, [C++](https://devdocs.io/cpp/) docs and many forums such as StackOverflow and Reddit.

## How it is organized?

Pretty simple, all the libs and stuff are inside the source code
this may be not a very good practice, this whole C++ world is new
to me. 

So, no need to install anything besides the usual C++ compiler and 
make sure you have the cmake extension in your VSCode, Vim, etc.

### Project structure
```bash
- assets # The shaders code, images, sounds, etc...
- include # The public library, that would be shared
- libs # The dependencies or internal libraries
- src # The source code itself
```

## Wanna contribute? 🫱🏿‍🫲🏼

Fork the project, do some cool stuff and PR it back!
